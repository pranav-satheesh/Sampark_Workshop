The top panel should show $h_+$, the center panel $h_\\times$, and the bottom panel should show the amplitude $A = \\sqrt{h_+^2 + h_\\times^2}$. All as a function of time. Label everything nicely, use good axis ranges. Also annotate the time of merger (defined as the time of maximum amplitude) in all three panels with a thick dashed line.\n",
